== Branch naming convention

In order to keep branches clear and expressive, please use the following prefixes:

* `feature/` when implementing a new feature
* `fix/` when fixing a bug/issue
* `improvement/` when improving the code base (both production code and test code)

== Test the project locally

[source, shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/RoRoche/eo-plantuml-builder
$ git fetch
----

Then in the `build.gradle` file, change the line 15 to set the version you want.

Then publish it to local Maven using `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`

In the consuming `build.gradle` file:

.build.gradle
[source, groovy]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    mavenLocal()
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.github.roroche:eo-plantuml-builder:{version}"
}
